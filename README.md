Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Pipenv for managing dependencies (optional)
OBS WebSocket plugin installed and configured (for OBS integration)
Streamer.bot set up and running (for command integration)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/whisperAI.git
cd whisperAI
Install Dependencies
Using Pipenv:

bash
Copy code
pipenv install
If you are not using Pipenv, install dependencies manually:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
API Keys: Update the config.yaml file in the config/ directory with your OpenAI API key and OBS WebSocket credentials.

yaml
Copy code
openai_api_key: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
obs_websocket:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 4444
  password: "your_obs_password"
OBS Setup: Ensure OBS is running with the WebSocket plugin enabled and configured according to your settings in config.yaml.

Streamer.bot Setup: Configure Streamer.bot to receive commands from WhisperAI by setting up appropriate actions and WebSocket connections.

Usage
Running Whisp
Start the PyQt GUI by running whisp.py:

bash
Copy code
python whisp.py
The GUI will launch, allowing you to:

Enter commands and send them to Streamer.bot.
Control OBS scenes directly from the GUI.
Interact with the voice assistant using GPT-4.
Running the Flask Server (Optional)
If you are using Flask for handling external requests, start the Flask server with:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will enable external services to send commands to WhisperAI via HTTP requests.

Integration with OBS and Streamer.bot
OBS Integration
WhisperAI can interact with OBS via WebSocket to perform tasks such as:

Changing scenes based on user commands.
Triggering overlays or animations.
Streamer.bot Integration
You can send commands to Streamer.bot directly from the Whisp GUI or via voice commands. This allows for real-time interaction with your Twitch chat and automated responses or actions.
